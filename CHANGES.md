# What changed, and why

This file lists every change made to the Windfall source since the files
were attached on 10 November 2026. Newest first.

How to read the history: the very first commit in this repository holds
the 39 files exactly as attached. Every change below is a later commit,
so GitHub and Xcode can show you each one line by line.

## Corrected set (10 November 2026)

**The aim:** make the 39 files agree with each other so the project can
build. Nothing new was added and no design was changed.

**How it was checked:** see "How this was checked" at the end.

### 1. `WildlifeModels.swift`: sighting record renamed

- **Change:** the record type `Observation` is now `WildlifeObservation`.
- **Why:** Apple has its own framework called Observation. Two things
  with one name confuse the compiler. Eleven other files already used
  the new name, so this file was the odd one out.
- **What the code means:** a "type" is a kind of record. Renaming it
  changes what every other file calls it, which is why all files must
  agree.

### 2. `WildlifeModels.swift`: photos link added

- **Change:** `var photoIdentifiers: [String]` was replaced by a link to
  the `Photo` record:
  ```swift
  @Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade, inverse: \Photo.observation)
  var photos: [Photo]? = []
  ```
- **Why:** photos used to be remembered as a list of text labels. They
  are now proper `Photo` records, and `Journal.swift` expects a sighting
  to link to them.
- **What the code means:**
  - `@Relationship` tells SwiftData that two record types are linked.
  - `inverse: \Photo.observation` names the matching link on the other
    side, so each photo knows which sighting it belongs to.
  - `deleteRule: .cascade` means deleting a sighting also deletes its
    photos, so none are left orphaned.
  - `[Photo]? = []` is an optional list that starts empty. iCloud sync
    requires links to be optional.

### 3. `WildlifeModels.swift`: missing field added

- **Change:** added `var associatedPlantName: String?` to
  `WildlifeObservation`.
- **Why:** five files read or write this field (the sightings screen,
  backup, export, sheet sync and Eira's tools) but it was never defined.
  The project could not have built without it.
- **What the code means:** the sighting keeps the plant's name as plain
  text as well as the link to the plant record. If the plant is later
  removed from the library, the sighting still says what it was on.
  `Survey` already does the same with `targetPlantName`.

### 4. `PlantModels.swift`: photos links added to three records

- **Change:** `PhenologyEvent` and `PestDiseaseEvent` swapped
  `photoIdentifiers` for a `photos` link. `Harvest` gained a `photos`
  link it never had.
- **Why:** the same reason as change 2. `Journal.swift` defines the
  `Photo` side of all three links, and a link must exist on both sides.

### 5. `AuthenticationManager.swift`: moved to `@Observable`

- **Change:** `class AuthenticationManager: ObservableObject` with
  `@Published` properties became `@Observable final class
  AuthenticationManager` with plain properties.
- **Why:** these are two generations of the same idea. Both let a screen
  redraw when sign-in state changes. The settings screen already asked
  for the newer kind, and an app must use one kind consistently.
- **What the code means:** `@Observable` watches every property
  automatically, so `@Published` is no longer needed. `final` means no
  other class can build on this one, which the compiler likes.

### 6. `RootView.swift` and `SignInView.swift`: new wiring

- **Change:** `@EnvironmentObject var authManager` became
  `@Environment(AuthenticationManager.self) private var authManager`,
  and the previews use `.environment(...)`.
- **Why:** this is how a screen asks for an `@Observable` object. It
  goes with change 5.

### 7. `WindfallApp.swift`: full record list and shared objects

- **Change:**
  - The schema now lists all 22 record types. It listed 13.
  - `@StateObject` became `@State`, and `.environmentObject` became
    `.environment`.
  - A `LocationManager` is now created and handed to every screen.
- **Why:**
  - A record type missing from the schema is silently never saved.
    Nine were missing, including the diary, photos and reference data.
  - The wiring change goes with change 5.
  - Two screens ask for the location manager. Without it the app would
    crash when either opened.
- **What the code means:** the schema is the list of record types the
  app is allowed to store. `.environment(...)` passes a shared object
  down to every screen.

### 8. `EiraChatView.swift`: two small fixes

- **Change:** the manual lookup buttons now build their request with
  `JSONSerialization` instead of pasting text into a string by hand.
  An unused name was also removed to clear a compiler warning.
- **Why:** typing a quotation mark into the box used to break the
  lookup, because the hand-built text was no longer valid.
- **What the code means:** JSON is a standard way of writing structured
  data as text. Letting the system write it means special characters
  are handled properly.

### 9. `docs/windfall-manifest.md`: heading corrected

- The heading said 33 files. The tables list 39, and 39 is right.

## Known problems that were deliberately left alone

These live in the part of Eira that talks to a model server. That part
is being replaced by on-device models, so mending it would be wasted
work. The replacement is on the `eira-on-device` branch.

1. Multi-step lookups are likely to fail, because the model's request
   for a tool is not recorded in the conversation.
2. Changing the model settings has no effect until the chat screen is
   reopened.
3. With no server address set, sending a message does nothing.
4. Conversations are not saved.
5. Tailscale and Ollama are still mentioned in three files.

One more thing to know: if the Xcode project is ever switched to "Swift
6 language mode", `EiraTools.swift` will need a small change. It is fine
in the default mode.

## How this was checked

There is no Mac in the place this work was done, so the app itself was
not built. Three things were done instead, and you can repeat them with
`Tools/checks/run-checks.sh`.

1. **Syntax check, all 39 files.** Each file was read by the real Swift
   parser (Swift 6.2). All pass.
2. **Full type check, 17 files.** The files that hold the app's logic
   were compiled with screens removed and small stand-ins for Apple-only
   types. All pass with no errors and no warnings. Run on the files as
   originally attached, the same check fails, which shows it catches
   real faults.
3. **Cross-file checks, all 39 files.** Every record type is in the
   schema. Every link between records exists on both sides. No screen
   uses a property that a record lacks. iPhone-only and Mac-only code is
   fenced off for the right platform.

**What this does not prove:** that the app builds. The 22 screen files
were only syntax-checked and cross-checked, because SwiftUI does not
exist outside Apple's platforms. Expect some errors on the first build
in Xcode. They should be few, and each one will be explained as it is
fixed.
